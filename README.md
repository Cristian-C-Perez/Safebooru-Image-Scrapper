# The unofficial Safebooru Image Scrapper

### A Python 3 script that allows you to scrape the first page of whatever you want searched.

This script assumes you have the BeautifulSoup module downloaded for Python 3 via pip:

```
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
```

It utilizes the JSON file as a means of converting certain tags to the ones Safebooru recognizes.

##### NOTE: This JSON file is incomplete, it converts certain tags but not all, keep this in mind when utilizing this script.
